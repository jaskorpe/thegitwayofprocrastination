Random files. Some have made my life easier.

For now:

- A makefile for latex and bibtex. Support for svg to pdf and eps
  which could be included by your latex project. Uses inkscape with no
  gui to convert.

- A sort of template for a masters thesis. Do not follow it
  blindly. Some things in it are probably stupid.

- Elisp script used to publish web content
